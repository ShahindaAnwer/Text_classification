# Text_classification

## Problem Statement

Proper communication a vital part of being human. The world has become very connected, therefore, with as many languages as there are, translation provides a critical cultural and economic bridge between people from different countries and ethnic groups.

## Model

### RNN:
A recurrent neural network is needed as it allows time-series context to flow through the network. RNNs take in sequences of text as inputs or return sequences of text as outputs, I used a many-to-many process where the input is a sequence of English words and the output is a sequence of French words.

Each rectangle is a vector and arrows represent functions, the green vectors hold the RNNâ€™s state
